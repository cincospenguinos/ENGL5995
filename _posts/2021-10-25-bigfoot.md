There's some important insights that come from this map.

### Bigfoot can swim

Check out longitude -180, latitude 40.16471. There are two locations there where Bigfoot was seen in the middle of the ocean. This means that Bigfoot is an incredible swimmer--he can show up far out in the ocean, miles and miles away from land. It's possible that Bigfoot can breathe in the water too!

### Bigfoot has a lot of homes...

Bigfoot has been sighted across the United Sates, including Alaska. This means that Bigfoot is able to meander around from place to place, staying with friends while he's around. Bigfoot is an all-american guy, possibly owning the most real-estate in the country.

### ...or Bigfoot is a vagabond

Bigfoot is pulling a real Johnny Appleseed here, spreading his face far and wide across the USA. He has no home, he has no mission, except to be sighted at various places around the country, including the ocean where the country isn't. [The Mormons just might be right on this front](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23289895?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents).

## But Bigfoot is definitely real.

Definitely. Absolutely. No reason to not believe.
